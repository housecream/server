2.0.0
2009-04-11
Stefan Frings

This release is based on uIP_Crumb644-NET_V1.3.

IP-Address is still hardcoded to 192.168.0.14 in CP2200.c.

Major parts have been rewritten to fix errors, implement new functions
and add missing documentation. There are so many changes, I cant list them
all here. But these are the highlights:

- Much better performance sending file >1.4kB. The crumb644 photo is 3.3kb
  small and sending it to a Linux PC took 3 seconds! Now it takes less
  than 0.1 seconds. The trick was to insert the TCP option NODELAY into
  the uIP code.
  
- File statistics are working now and the list of filenames is generated
  automatically.
  
- Network statistics display now correct values. Some of them were swapped
  obviously.
  
- The old firmware did not deliver files (images and css) sometimes, and 
  sometimes the whole progfram crashed. This has been resolved.
  
- The ethernet controller did not start-up properly when the power supply
  starts slowly. I had trouble with a 5.2V power supply from an old 
  cellphone. This has been resolved by replacing the soft reset by a
  hard reset with enough delay time.
  
- A lot of checks have been added to prevent crashes caused by unexpected
  HTTP requests.
  
- All code that was not related to Crumb644-NET has been removed, specially
  access to I/O lines.
  
- The LED IO page has been enhanced to support both LED's and display
  the current LED status. Of course, the toggle buttons do still exist. 
  This is the only function that acceses any external I/O line.
  
- The red LED does not blink anymore, so you can use it for whatever 
  else you like.

- The makefile has been rewritten. I handle file dependencies now 
  correctly. It also converts the html files automatically to char 
  arrays, so there is no need anymore for any other external hex 
  converter.

- The perl script for file-to-char array conversion has been fixed to
  produce correct code.
  
- The text file with string constants has been replaced by inline strings
  directly in the related source code files.
  
- Some string constants have been moved from RAM to program memory (flash),
  to free up some bytes of memory.

- Some string variables have been replaced by pointers to already 
  existing data, to save about 40 bytes memory per connection.
  
- uIP has been modified to skip sending empty packages, they caused
  an immediate crash before.
  
- A content-type header for XML files has been added.

- A lot of suspicious pointer arithmetic has been replaced by better
  human readable code.
  
- The whole cgi scripting stuff has been replaced code that is smaller,
  much better readable and with more functions. Indeed, the name 
  was quite misleading, because cgi scripts are a totally different thing.
  The new names are httpd_functions.c and user_functions.c.
  
- The new function concept allows calling functions by tags in .shtml 
  files (as before) plus calling them by URL. In addition, functions
  can now be called with parameters, which was not possible before.

- function calls and include files in *.shtml can now be terminated
  by line break, file-end or space. Previously, only line break was
  supported.
  
- The source code has been structured with sub-directories to give
  better overview what files belong together. Some unused files and
  files that are not used anymore have been removed.

- The almost not existing documentation has been added. The whole source
  of the webserver should be self-explaining now. I highly recommend
  to read the uIP manual chapters about Protothreads and then Protosockets.
