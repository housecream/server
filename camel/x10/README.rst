Here is the original X10 java protocol implemented by http://www.jpeterson.com/ (jpeterson-x10.tar.gz)
and the updated version from http://www.agaveblue.org/ (tjx10p-13src.zip)

this java lib support PC / X10 communication using a CM11A and CM17A protocol.

This needs a serial communication on the computer and a CM11A component to work.

For now we don't have the time and the equipment necessary to implement the plugin.

If you want to use X10 with Housecream, you can ask us for help on the integration of this lib in a new Housecream plugin.
